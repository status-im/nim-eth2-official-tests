# nim-eth2-official-tests

This repo reformats the official Ethereum 2 tests to a format suitable for [Nimbus](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus)/[nim-beacon-chain](https://github.com/status-im/nim-beacon-chain).

## Cloning the repo

Due to upstream usage of [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com) to store the large test vectors,
there is an extra step after cloning the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/status-im/nim-eth2-official-tests
cd nim-eth2-official-tests
git lfs install
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Usage in nim-beacon-chain

### For v0.7.1 to v0.8.1

This repository is meant to be used in the devel branch of the [Nimbus build environment](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus)
where it appears as a submodule in `nimbus/vendor/nim-beacon-chain/tests/official/fixtures`.

This repository contains patches to Nim and NimYAML created to work around a number of outstanding issues:
  - no YAML support in [nim-serialization](https://github.com/status-im/nim-serialization) library
    which allows well-tested serialization and deserialization into and from Ethereum types.
  - [NimYAML](https://nimyaml.org) uses int by default for numerals and cannot deserialize
    18446744073709551615 (2^64-1), the FAR_FUTURE_SLOT constant.
  - Furthermore as of 0.7.1, the yaml test files includes thousands of random epochs
    in the [2^63-1 .. 2^64-1] range for the `source_epoch` and `target_epoch` field.
  - All those workarounds requires an intermediate reformatted JSON file, but the tests are huge (100k+ lines)
    and will cause review issues in the main repo.

The required patch application is automated in the `run_batch_convert_v0.8.1.nims` script. After executing it, you'll find all
converted test vectors in the `json_tests_v0.8.1` folder.

### For v0.8.3

The huge tests now have a Simple-Serialize (SSZ) version that should be preferred
as it's more compact and do not use Git LFS on the EF side (and risk hitting Github LFS quota ceiling)

Small tests like BLS and shuffling are YAML only and do not have conversion issue
as they do not use high uint64 numbers.
